      <p>This blog is inspired by my participation in <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com">Free Code Camp</a>. I began the Free Code Camp course several months ago and spent a couple of weeks fully focused on it, sitting in my office (aka garage) by myself and interacting online. Learning always goes better when you have people to learn with so I started a Free Code Camp study group. The group has been active for only 10 weeks but has progressed from 1 meeting per week to two.</p>
      <p>Without exception the people who come to the study group want a job, a different job, a better job and of couse a better paying job. The attendees are smart and dedicated. They are managing work and family while working to improve their lives.</p>
      <p>You can find our group on Facebook <a href="#">Free Code Camp ... ,,,</a> and on Meetup <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Tri-Valley-East-Bay-Free-Code-Camp-Study-Group/">Tri-Valley / East Bay Free Code Camp Study Group</a>.</p>

      <h2>Target Audiance</h2>
      <p>This blog is geared toward those learning to code. The posts are written with the assumption the reader has basic computer skills but no technical background. I have two prototype readers in mind as I write:
        1) Person A: Has used a computer for work. They are comfortable using productivity applications such as a word processor and spreasheet, navigating and using the internet and installing software on a Windows or Mac. Person a has never coded and does not understand what is happening under the surface.
        2) Person B: Is an experienced graphics designer. They have designed web sites, know HTML & CSS and are highly proficient at using complex software such as Adobe Photoshop. They may have dabbled in JavaScript but have never mastered any programming language.

        I am striving to write on a level that will help these readers, but it has been a couple of decatdes since I was one of them so I'm left wondering about the ways I no longer understand their needs. I welcome comments on this page regarding how I can better speak to these readers.



      <h2>Who is Klequis?</h2>
      <p>I have been a software developer since the early 90s.
      <p>I have played every major role in the software process from idea generation and requirements gathering to deployment. I have been an Excel guru, software developer, software develoment manager, project manager and product manager.</p>

      <p>I have built applications in the domains of user productivity, document authoring, document management, knowledge management, information overload, Investment Banking, market data and CRM.</p>

      <p>My favorite part of the software development process is watching users make use of what I have been part of creating.</p>

      <p>I am currently an organizer of <a href="#">Free Code Camp, San Ramon</a> and <a href="#">Tri-Valley / East Bay Fee Code Camp Study Group</a> and a multirotor builder and flyer.</p>

      <p>While I have dabbled in many technologies, here are the ones I worked with the most, roughly chronical order:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Windows 3.0 - 8.1</li>
        <li>Excel, PowerPoint and Word automation using VBA</li>
        <li>Visual Basic 4 - 6</li>
        <li>Client / server developer</li>
        <li>Sybase</li>
        <li>SQL</li>
        <li>Documentum</li>
        <li>C#, WPF, Silverlight, ASP.NET</li>
        <li>Verity search engine</li>
        <li>SharePoint</li>
        <li>SQL Server</li>

      </ul>

======================================================




My guides, I call them guides, are tutorials, not quick reference. They are meant for users who need explanation and guidance. However, they are not so long such that an experienced user cannot use as a reference.


<h2>Who is the blog meant for?</h2>
<p>The target audience of this blog is people with basic to advance computer skills who want to learn to be software developers, or experienced developers  exploring new technologies.</p>

<h2>Who is Karl?</h2>
<p>I'm an aging software developer who doen't have to work 10+ hours a day anymore and so I have time to go back to were my career with software began - exploring technology that interests and facinates me.</p>





<h2>Why use Ubuntu?</h2>
<p>The short answer is that it is free, easy to install and easy get started with.</p>

<h2>Why use GNOME?</h2>
<p>Largely because the UI appeals to me more than the default Ubuntu Unity UI. I like the simplicity and the ability to customize it via shell extensions.</p>
