I frequently create new files from Files (aka Nautilus). However, Ubuntu Gnome does not come with this functionality. Fortunately, it is easy to implement.

To check if you need to do this, open Files to a location where you have permission to create files. Your Home/Documents directory is a good choice. Right-ckick and see if New Document appears on the context menu. As you can see it does not in the screenshot. Even if you have it already, you can add different file types if desired.

I'm going to create 3 file types for the 3 types of files I use most often: .txt, .html & .php.
Open Terminal execute the below commands
$ cd ~/Templates
$ touch Text.txt HTML.html PHP.php
As you can see in the screenshot, you now have the option to create 3 file types. Add more as you require.
