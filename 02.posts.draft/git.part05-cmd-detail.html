  <h1>Git Commands in Detail</h1>
  <p>In this part of the tutotorial we will go over the most common Git commands in greater detail than we did earlier. Let's jump right in.</p>
  <p class="ke-callout ke-callout-info">A directory is a folder. Windows uses the term 'folder'. Linux calls them 'directories'.</p>

  <!-- project setup -->
  <h2>Creating a Sample Project</h2>
  <p>For this part of the tutorial we will create a new project and a new GitHub repository.</p>
  <h3>Create a GitHub Account</h3>
  <p>If you already have a GitHub account you can skip this step.</p>
  <p>Create a GitHub account by going to <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. Give your user name some thought. GitHub is a very public place which people use to help develop their identity as a developer. You will store your code here and may in the future share it with other developers or with a potential employer to show your abilities.</p>
  <h3>Create a GitHub Repository</h3>
  <p>In the upper righ-hand corner of the GitHub page, click the '+' sign and select <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs">New repository</button>.</p>
  <img src="../images//using-git-github/004.01.new-repository.png" alt="showing use of git init" />
  <p>Fill out the repository details as show below and then click <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Create repository</button>. Make sure to leave the other choices as is.</p>
  <img src="../images//using-git-github/018.01.new-github-repository.png" alt="showing use of git init" />
  <h3>Create the Project Files &amp; Directories</h3>
  <p class="ke-callout ke-callout-info">It doesn't matter how you create the project files as long as the file and directory names match. I'm using Linux. '~' stands for the 'home' directory and I create all my projects in a folder named 'workspace'. You do not have to create your project in the same location. I am providing command line instructions for creating the project. You could do the same using a file manager or text editor.</p>
  <p>... and then execute the following commands. Don't worry what they mean for now, they will be explained below.</p>
  <p>In Terminal, make sure the current directory is ~/workspace/</p>
  <pre>$ cd ~/workspace<br>$ mkdir sample-project<br>$ cd sample-project<br>$ touch index.html README.md<br>$ mkdir css<br>$ cd css<br>$ touch style.css</pre>
  <p>Your project structure should now look like this:</p>
  <img src="../images/using-git-github/019.01.project-structure.png" alt="initial file structure" />
  <p>Let's put some content in the files.</p>
  <div class="file-box">
    <div class="file-name">
      index.html
    </div>
    <div class="file-body">
      <pre class="pre-file-body">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>&lt;head&gt;<br>  &lt;title&gt;sample-project&lt;/title&gt;<br>  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"&gt;<br>&lt;/head&gt;<br>&lt;body&gt;<br>  &lt;h1&gt;Hello World, once again.&lt;/h1&gt;<br>&lt;/body&gt;</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="file-box">
    <div class="file-name">
      style.css
    </div>
    <div class="file-body">
      <pre class="pre-file-body">body {<br>  background-color: lightgray<br>}</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="file-box">
    <div class="file-name">
      README.md
    </div>
    <div class="file-body">
      <pre class="pre-file-body">#Git Tutorial ReadMe</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Open index.html in a browser</p>
  <img src="../images/using-git-github/002.01.git-tutorial-mozilla-firefox.png" alt="initial file structure" />
  <p>If you use <code>$ git status</code> now it will show there is no Git repository with the message, "fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git".</p>
  <img src="../images/using-git-github/015.01.not-a-git-repository.png" alt="git repository deleted" />

  <!-- git init -->
  <h2><code>$ git init</code> - Creating a New Git Repository</h2>
  <p>Using <code>$ git init</code> to create a new repository is straight-forward. Here are steps for creating a new project with <code>$ git init</code></p>
  <p>Create the project's root directory if it does not already exist.</p>
  <pre>$ mkdir sample-project</pre>
  <p>Make sure you are inside the projects root directory.</p>
  <pre>$ cd sample-project</pre>
  <p>Create the repository.</p>
  <pre>$ git init</pre>
  <img src="../images//using-git-github/012.01.git-init.png" alt="showing use of git init" />

  <!-- git add -->
  <h2><code>$ git add</code> - Staging Files</h2>
  <p class="ke-callout ke-callout-info">As noted in an earlier part of this tutorial series, <code>$ git add</code> does not add the files to the repository, it adds them to a staging area in preparation for using <code>$ git commit</code> which will actually put them into the repository.</p>
  <p>You do not have to add directories to Git. As you add files Git will preserve the directory structure. Let's go through an exercise to illustrate how <code>$ git add</code> works.</p>
  <p>Add a new empty repository.</p>
  <pre>$ git init</pre>
  <p><code>$ git status</code> will show that we have two files and one directory. However, as you know, there is a third file inside of css/ which <code>$ git status</code> does not show. Using the <code>--all</code> option will add all files at once, including the style.css file inside of css/.</p>
  <pre>$ git status<br>$ git add --all<br>$ git status</pre>
  <img src="../images/using-git-github/016.01.using-git-add-all.png" alt="git add --all" />

  <!-- git commit -->
  <h2><code>$ git commit</code></h2>
  <p><code>$ git commit</code> takes the files in the staging area and puts them into the repository. Unless you use the <code>--allow-empty-message</code> option, a message/comment is required.</p>
  <p>For the beginner developers reading this I'll let you know we are about to discuss something that is very important to developers.</p>
  <p>It is a best practice to always have a message and if you are working with a team, committing without a message will most likely result in some form a repramand.</p>
  <p>The message can be very short and it should describe the changes to the files being committed. To achieve this you need to stage and commit files with a related change such that you message could be something like, "Updated sidebar and related styles", for which you are likely committing in a .html and .css file. If you add to this commit a change you made to the text of another .html file then you comment becomes wordy like, 'did this to these files and that to those files, etc.'. Additionally, it becomes hard to revert one change without the other. Therefore, commits should include the files for one change and the message should succintly describe that change.</p>
  <p>All of this does not mean you cannot make unrelated changes to multiple files before committing. You simply move the files for one change into the staging area and commit, then stage the files for the next change and commit.</p>
  <p>Let's commit our files. This is the first time they are being committed and the traditional message for that is, "initial commit". Commit will move everything in the staging area to the repository.</p>
  <p><code>-m</code>means 'message'. What follows in quotes is the message.</p>
  <pre>$ git commit -m "initial commit"</pre>
  <a href="../images/using-git-github/017.01.git-commit.png"><img class="img-responsive img-step-figure" src="../images/using-git-github/017.01.git-commit.png" alt="$ git commit"></a>
  <p>Using the above picture, let's take a closer look at the message produced by <code>$ git commit</code>.</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
        [master (root-commit) 9fe2f2a] initial commit
      </td>
      <td>
        The commit was to branch 'master', which is the root, not a branch. The message was 'initial commit'.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        3 file changed
      </td>
      <td>
        Right, we changed 3 files
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        13 insertions(+)
      </td>
      <td>
        If you count the lines of code in the 3 files we committed there are 13 of them. Since this is the initial commit they all count as an insertions which is indicated by a (+) sign.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        create mode
      </td>
      <td>
        They are new files so they were created.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <!-- git push -->
  <h2><code>$ git push</code> - Pushing Code to GitHub</h2>
  <p><code>$ git push</code> will move the changes in your local repository to the remote repository on GitHub.</p>
  <p>The syntax of <code>$ git push </code> is...</p>
  <pre>git push [remote-name] [branch-name]</pre>
  <p>Since our remote-name is 'origin' and our current branch-name is 'master', execute the push command as follows:</p>
  <pre>$ git push origin master</pre>
  <p>When prompted, enter you GitHub user name and password.</p>
  <p>That's it, your chnages are now in the GitHub repository! Take a look at your project's GitHub page to confirm the files are added.</p>
  <p class="ke-callout ke-callout-info">It is worth taking a moment to realize the process of committing and push to GitHub requires only three commands, add, commit and push.</p>

  <p>Let's take a closer look at <code>$ git push</code> and its output.</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><code>$ git push origin master</code></td>
      <td><code>$git push</code> moves you chnages from your local machine to GitHub. 'master', as you have already seen, is the current branch you are working on. 'origin' is a 'remote' (see next definition). It is a label that contains the path to the GitHub repository.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>
    *outline**<br>

    Master is branch ... know already<br>
    origin is the name of remote<br>
    Remote, explain 'remote'<br>
    url's - make clear that they are the git hub repository url's and compare them to the actual url's to make sure you are correct.<br>
    3 objects<br>
    master -&ght; master from local master to remote master<br>
  */outline**
  </p>
  <p>To understand origin you need to understand 'remote'. Remote refers to the repository on GitHub. Execute the below command.</p>
  <pre>$ git remote -v</pre>
  <p>Given the results in the screenshot it appears that 'origin' is a name for something that holds a URL, and it is. It is the name of the Git repository on GitHub, but not the name you gave it. Git assigned this name when you did the clone. You can change it if you want to but for the moment there is no need to.</p>
  <p>You'll note that there is 'fetch' and 'push'. These are the URLs that Git will use to fetch data from and push data to GitHub.</p>
  <h4>master -&gt; master</h4>
  <p>This means we move date from the master branch in our local repository to the master branch on the remote repository (i.e., the repository on GitHub).</p>

  <p>In this section I will walk you through using some of the most common Git commands while creating a very simple website to illustrate their use. You can use whichever text editor you prefer, but since we isntalled Atom, let's use it.</p>

  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Let's add a file to the project and then to Git.</p>
  <p>In Atom, right-click on the project directory and choose <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs">New file</button>.</p>
  <p>Make the file contents as show as below.</p>
  <pre>&lt;h1&gt;Using Git with GitHub&lt;/h1&gt;<br>&lt;p class="green-text"&gt;This is some green text.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;p class="blue-text"&gt;Some blue text here.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
  <a href="../images/using-git-github/016.01.new.file.in.project.png"><img class="img-responsive img-step-figure" src="../images/using-git-github/016.01.new.file.in.project.png" alt="**alt**"></a>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h2><code>$ git status</code></h2>
  <p>Switch to Terminal and make you current directory ~/workspace/git-github-tutorial.</p>
  <pre>$ cd ~/workspace/git-github-tutorial</pre>
  <p>Check your repositories status when the below command.</p>
  <pre>$ git status</pre>
  <p>Here is a view of words and phrases in the status</p>
  <p>Now let's take a closer look at <code>$ git status</code> which we executed above.</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><b>master</b></td>
      <td>Git is like a tree. You can create branches to you tree. Each branch is a complete version of your project. The default branch is called 'master'. Look at your GitHub home page and find the dropdown that says "Branch: master".111</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>origin</b></td>
      <td>'origin' is a name has associated with the repository on your local machine. As we will see later, it holds the URL to the repository on GitHub.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'</b></td>
      <td>This message means that the repository on your local machine matches the repository on GitHub. It does not mean that everthing in your project directory matches what is on GitHub. You probably need to understand 'commit' before you can understand this. So come back and read this again once you undertand 'commit'.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>'nothing to commit'</b></td>
      <td>In a simple sense this means, 'you have nothing ready to make permenant in the repository'. In Git language it says you have nothing in the repository's staging area.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>'working directory is clean'</b></td>
      <td>This means there is nothing in your project's directory that is not already in the Git repository on you local machine. It is not saying anything about the repository on GitHub.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <dl class="dl-horizontal">
    <dt>Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'</dt>
    <dd>While you have added a file to the project directory you have not added the file to the local Git repository so in fact the local and GitHub repositories are still the same.</dd>
    <dt>Untracked files</dt>
    <dd>index.html has not been added to Git yet so it is called 'untracked'</dd>
    <dt>nothing added to commit</dt>
    <dd>As you will see and do in a moment, 'commit' or 'committed' means 'has been added to Git'.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>
  This guide is a good learning experience and you can use its workflow to effectively work on a project. However it is not the right way to use Git. To effectively use Git in a way that allows you to manage the development life-cycle and to collaborate with other developers, you need to use 'branching'. I am currently working on a guide for branching. Subscribe to this blog to get notified when it is available.
