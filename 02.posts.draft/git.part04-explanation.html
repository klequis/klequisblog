          <p>Like many specialized subjects, Git has its own vocabulary and understanding Git well enough to make use of it requires that you learn its vocabulary. Here are some definitions to help with the next steps.</p>

              <td>'Working directory' is used to refer to files in the project's folder that are currently in a state other than committed. It contains all the files from one version of the project. In our example, the working directory is ~/workspace/git-github-tutorial. It is also the project's root directory.</td>

Take a look at your GitHub home page and find the dropdown that says 'Master'. Currently, your repository only has one branch, i.e., Master</td>

          <h2>Git Areas</h2>
          <p>There are four 'areas' that we will be working with. The first three are part of Git and are on you local machine. The fouth is GitHub. The term 'areas' is used but they are actually a combination of files and folders. For example, the 'staging area' is a file.</p>
