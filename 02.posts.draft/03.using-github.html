<h1>Using GitHub</h1>

<p>In this part of the tutorial you will setup a GitHub account, 'push' your project to a GitHub repository and learn how to keep your local repository in synch with the GitHub repository. Yes, that is a bit confusing as you will have a repository on your local machine and a repository on GitHub. However, but the end of the tutorial it will all make sense.</p>

<h2>Create a GitHub Account</h2>
<p>Go to <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> (github.com) and create an account. Give your user name some thought. GitHub is a very public place which people use to help develop their identity as a developer. You will store your code here and may in the future share it with other developers or with a potential employer to show your abilities. Once you account is setup and verified, follow the steps below to create your first repository.</p>
<h2>Create a GitHub Repository</h2>
<p>In the upper right-hand corner of the GitHub page, click on the '+' sign and select <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs">New repository</button>.</p>
<img src="../images/using-git-github/004.01.new-repository.png" alt="new github repository" />
<p>Fill out the repository details as show below and then click <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Create repository</button>.</p>
<img src="../images/using-git-github/005.01.new-repository-github.png" alt="new repository github" />
<h2>Add Your Local Repository to the GitHub Repository</h2>
<p>The next page shows three ways of populating the new repository. Since you already have an existing repository you want to use the second option <i>''â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line'</i>. Copy the two lines from this option, one at at time, to the command line and execute. First:</p>
<pre>$ git remote add origin https://github.com/demoacct-klequis/gittutorial.git</pre>
<p>The next command will prompt you first for your GitHub user name and then for your GitHub password.</p>
<pre>$ git push -u origin master</pre>
<p><code>$ git push</code> does what it implies. It pushes your code to GitHub.</p>
<p>Go back to GitHub and refresh the page. Your repository will now look like this:</p>
<img src="../images/using-git-github/007.01.files-in-github-repository.png" alt="new github repository with files" />
<h2>Updating GitHub as you Work</h2>
<p>Pushing to GitHub provides many benefits. Two big ones are backup and sharing.</p>
<p>Your work should always be backed-up regardless of how little time you spent on it. It is sometimes said that there are two kinds of people, those who have had a hard drive fail and those who will. There is also user error. Many years ago, before the days of DropBox and Google Drive, I had a hard drive fail. It was no big deal as I had a second hard drive in the machine with all the data backed-up. Unfortunately, when trying to fix the primary drive I mistakenly reformatted the wrong hard drive and lost most of the pictures from the first two years of my marriage. It is still painful to think about. Mistakes do happen. Push you code to GitHubat least once a day.</p>
<p>While you are learning to code you may or may not have a reason to share your code with or co-develope a project with another developer. However, once you are a developer it is more than likely you will do both of these things. Get into the habit of committing and pushing your code now.</p>
<p>Below is the process as we have developed it so far. It is simplistic and not adequate for managing a large project, but it is complete enough to hvae you code commited to Git and backed-up onto GitHub.</p>
<pre><ol><li>$ git add --all</li><li>$ git commit -m "describe the changes in the message"</li><li>$ git push origin master</li></ol></pre>

<p>There are other ways to add, commit and push which you will learn later in this tutorial.</p>
