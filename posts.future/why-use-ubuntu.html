This post is mostly my opionion. Any facts presented are gathered from internet search and have not been extensively fact checked.

As you can see from the scope and detail of my blog, I have made a large investment in Ubuntu & GNOME. I read the Linux v Mac & Windows arguments regulary. I would like to say I'm not interested but I do read them so I must be. What I am really doing is trying to confirm that I have made the right choice.

Mac/Apple is expensive and I feel a little burned by Microsoft as they have increasingly taken away privacy. First Windows 8 would have you use a 'Microsoft Account' to log in, which means Microsft knows every time you log into you computer, and then Windows 10 which seems a huge increase in tracking what the user does. These two factors, cost and privacy, moved me to Linux. I choose Ubuntu because of its reputation of usability and stability.

Should I use Ubuntu/Linux
Is Ubuntu/Linux harder than Windows or Mac?

Is Linux hard to use.
I have spent lots of time installing development tools on Windows machines. It wasn't always easy. Is Linux harder? I would say 'yes, but not that much.' It is certaintly not as bad as often portrayed around the internet. As a case in point, several months ago I installed Ubuntu Gnome on my wife and 10 year old son's laptops. Neither of are technical and neither could care less. I was especially surprised for my wife as she is not at all technical. My son took to customizing his desktop and has created a fun looking UI to use.


Is Ubuntu GNOME better than Windows or Mac?
I could be indirect and say it depends on how you define 'better', but I won't. A better question might be why I use Ubuntu GNOME, but that whould also be avoiding the question. So let's get straight to the point. No, it isn't and yes it is. I think Windows is easier to use but then I have been a Windows user and developer since the early ninties so it would seem easy to me. I don't use a Mac but it has a reputation for ease of use and beauty which I believe is well deserved. So what is so good about Ubuntu and GNOME? Read on.


What is Ubuntu
Ubuntu is a computer operating system. It is Linux and based on Debian. To learn more about that https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_(operating_system)

What is GNOME?
GNOME is a desktop environment that can be used on Ubuntu and other Linux operating systems. It can partially be thought about as a theme or skik that changes the say the UI looks, but it is more than that. GNOME comes with a set of default applications and is based on core technologies choosen by the GNOME Project https://www.gnome.org/. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME

Why use GNOME and Ubuntu?
This could be answered spearately and together. I use GNOME because it is free and Ubuntu because when I was new to Linux it was easy to install and start using for developing software. I continue to use it because it is reliable and well supported.

The more I read about using Ubuntu/Linux v Windows or Mac the less interested I am in the subject. I'll refrain from saying why you or anyone else should use it and stick why it works for me. There are three simple reasons, 1) it is free as is all of the software I use to do my work, 2) I have to learn a lot of underlying stuff to use it and so feel it broadens my knowledge base and 3) I support the idea of free software for all those who can't affort expensive software and high-end machines.


Lets dig into the details

<b>"It's FREE!"</b> Yes, you pay nothing for Ubuntu, GNOME and the vast majority of apps that run on it. I have ever app I need and paid for none of them. I do make small contributions to the creators of the software I use.

Ubuntu is well <b>supported</b> both in terms of updates and its support commuity. Improvements, but fixes and security patches are delivered promptly. The Ubuntu user forums are friendly and questions get answered. Ubuntu LTS (long-term support) releases are supported for 5 years.

"Free software" Ubuntu has a 'package management' system for installing, upgrading, configuring and removing software. This library of software is extensive and the software in it is check by Ubuntu as well as the open source community so it is most often safe to install. Two of the notable applications other than developer tools are Libre Office and GIMP. Libre Office is a suite of applications similar to Microsoft Office. In my humble opinion Libre Office is not as good as Microsoft Office but it is free, full-featured and free. GIMP is similar to to and has most of the features of Photoshop but completely free. There is not up-front fee and no subscription. There are many more free software packages avilable which will enable to accomplish anything you want with Ubuntu GNOME.

Ubuntu GNOME does not get slower with use like another well know operating system does. I have a 3.5 Ubuntu virtual machine that is low on disk space but it runs just as fast as it did the day I first built it.

Ubuntu GNOME is less demanding of system resources so it runs faster on lower spec / older hardware than some other operating systems.

Myth or Fact?
-------------
Ubuntu and Linux in general are more stable
Back in the ninties Windows would crash but in my experience Microsoft has solved this problem and I find it completely stable.

Ubuntu and Linux have no viruses
Like Mac, Ubuntu/Linux is based on UNIX which is less vaunerable to viruses. Does that mean it has no viruses? I doubt that but, I don't run a virus scanner on mine. I do have a firewall configured and I have virus software that I can run on specified files on demand, which is useful for downloads.

Ubuntu has no spyware?
Hum..., that is a good one given how much data computers are sucking-up these days. I read today that Ubuntu used to send all of your searches to a Conical server (Conical is the organization that creates Ubuntu), but is no longer doing so.

You can't use Ubuntu GNOME without knowing the commandline.
If you are a developer that is true. However, developers can already use the commandline. If you are endevoring to learn software development you should be plenty able to learn the commandline. If you are not a developer you can happily use Ubuntu GNOME without ever looking at the commandline.

The disadvantages
Some things are harder on Ubuntu. For example, I had to do some research to discovver how to connect my iPhone to Ubuntu.

Did I mention it is FREE!
This is no small thing. The belief that software should be free is based on the fact that access to computing technology will make a difference in a persons abilty to educate themselves, participate in the larger world and will ultimately impact their future income level. While I could plunk down $3000 for a Mac Pro many people can't and I'm too cheap.

Make a donation
Free is free and you can use Ubuntu GNOME and the applications that run on it without ever paying a dime. However, the people who devlope this software work hard at it and it would be a great show of your appreciation to send them a small donation. See the website for the projects you want to donate to and look for a donate link.
