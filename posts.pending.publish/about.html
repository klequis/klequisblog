      <p>This blog is inspired by my participation in <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com">Free Code Camp</a>. I began the Free Code Camp online course several months ago and spent a couple of weeks fully focused on it. I sat in my office (aka garage) by myself and interacted online. The online interaction helped me solve some problems but I soon began to feel isolated. To address that, I started a Free Code Camp study group. Learning always goes better when you have people to learn with face to face. The group has been active for only 10 weeks but has already progressed from one meeting per week to two.</p>
      <p>Without exception the people who come to the study group want a job, a different job and/or a better job, and of couse a better paying job. The attendees are smart and dedicated. They are managing work and family while working to improve their lives.</p>
      <p>You can find our group on Facebook <a href="#">Free Code Camp ... ,,,</a> and on Meetup <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Tri-Valley-East-Bay-Free-Code-Camp-Study-Group/">Tri-Valley / East Bay Free Code Camp Study Group</a>.</p>

      <h2>Target Audiance</h2>
      <p>This blog is geared toward those learning to code. The posts are written with the assumption the reader has basic computer skills but limited technical background. I have two prototype readers in mind as I write:
        <ul>
          <li>Person A: Has used a computer for work and home. They are comfortable using productivity applications such as a word processor and spreasheet, navigating and otherwise using the internet, and installing software on a Windows or Mac. Person A has never coded and does not understand what is happening under the surface of a software program.</li>
          <li>Person B: Is an experienced graphics designer. They have designed web sites, know HTML & CSS and are highly proficient at using complex software such as Adobe Photoshop. They may have dabbled in JavaScript but have never mastered any programming language.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>I am striving to write on a level that will help these readers. However, it has been a couple of decades since I was one of them, so I'm left wondering about the ways I no longer understand their needs. I welcome comments on this page regarding how I can better speak to these readers.</p>

    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>When I started college in 1990 I was already in my early thirties and had never done anything more with a computer than use a word processor. Getting through college while paying my own way was not easy, and when I graduated four years later, showing up for an entry level job as a recent college graduate, I ran into some pretty uncomfortable bumps. Twenty plus years later I have had a rewarding career, made some exciting software and been well rewarded for it.</p>
    <p>I would never take credit away from myself for my efforts getting through college as an adult and finding a rewarding job and career, but would never say I did it all by myself. Yes, I worked hard, had a full-time class schedule, worked 25 to 35 hours a week, ran out of money, ran up debt, and learned to code, all in one 4 year period. But I had a lot of help and a good amount of luck.</p>
    <p>The help I received was often not a lot of effort for the person helping but always very significant to me. One older friend would invite me to her home and stuff me with food while she and her husband would speak to me like parents giving advice and support to their child. She would also make me apple pie! There were others who invited me to holiday dinners and a couple of times a small loan of money so I could make my rent. My biggest break was when a friend learned that his cousin worked with the hiring manager at a firm I was interviewing at. He got his cousing to speak with the hiring manager and tell her how wonderful I was. She hired me and I had my first job as a software developer.</p>
    <p>My journey from non-technical adult to technologist working on Wall street was fun and exciting, but often hard and uncertain. I am forever greaful to the people who helped me along the way. I honestly think I would have burned-out and never made it without them. It is in this spirit that I have started this blog and the study group. I hope this blog and the study group will provide some small amout of help to those who want to do something new and exciting with their lives. Through the study group I have already met a lot of great people and been enriched by them.</p>
