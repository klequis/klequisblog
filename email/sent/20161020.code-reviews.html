                                <h1>Code Reviews</h1>
                                <p>In an effort to increase collaboration in the group and to help prepare members to find and prosper at work, we will begin having a code review as a regular part of our meetup. Every member is encouraged to submit their code for review <b>often!</b>.</p>

                                <h2>What is a code review?</h2>
                                <p>In its most general sense, a code review is a group of people reviewing code. Development groups have their own preferred way of running a code review with some having a more formal process than others. Regardless of where you work your code will be reviewed either formally or otherwise. The otherwise is other developers seeing you code, forming an opinion of how good of a coder you are and most likely discussing your short comings with other members of the team with or without your knowledge of it.</p>

                                <h2>Why volunteer for a code review?</h2>
                                <p>As a member of the group you are either learning your first programming language or a new one. In either case, feedback from others will accelerate your learning. If you are a new coder this will be reflected in your coding style. During the review you will get advice from the more experienced members on how to write more mature and higher quality code. If you are an experience developer learning a new language you will hopefully get ideas on how to better leverage your new language and you will benefit other members by sharing your code.</p>

                                <h2>What will happen at the code review</h2>
                                <p>The developer submitting their work for review ("code's author") will share it via a Google Hangouts screen share. They will walk the group through the code, answer questions, receive suggestions and of course compliments. There may or may not be consensus on a suggestion and the code's author may or may not agree with it. If there is not agreement we will spend a limited amount of time having a friendly discussion of the suggestion's merits and then move on. No one wins and no one looses.</p>

                                <h2>How do I volunteer</h2>
                                <p>Post a comment to the the discussion for the meetup session (i.e., specific date) you want to have your code reviewed. First come first serve. I'll keep a list in the event of more than one request per meeting.</p>

                                <h2>Rules &amp; Guidelines</h2>
                                <ol>
                                  <li>The perfect code to submit for review is a Free Code Camp project, or challenge or something of similar size. If you want a review of a larger project we can review the overall structure but for a code level review you will have to isolate a part of the project for the group to focus on.</li>
                                  <li>We will only review JavaScript based projects or the HTML &amp; CSS part of other project types. The groups experience is best suited to JavaScript, HTML &amp; CSS.</li>
                                  <li>The review will begin at the top of the meeting's second hour and last 15 to 30 minute. So start time is 10am on TH and 11am on SA.</li>
                                  <li>All participants must have a GMail account to participate in the screen share.</li>
                                  <li>All participants will be ready to join the screen share at the start time.</li>
                                  <li>The submitter will have decided in advance what they want to have reviewed and be ready to start without delay.</li>
                                  <li>If your code is not working bring it any way and we will do our best to help you get it working.</li>
                                  <li>Not everyone has to participate. As usual, if you want to quietly sit and code in the company of other coders, please do. (Karl will always participate).</li>
                                  <li>It is <b>highly suggested:</b> 1) that your code is in an editor such as Sublime or Atom (i.e., not CodePen) so that it is easier to view &amp; 2) you code is up on GitHub so we can edit together if desired.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <h2>But I just started and I'm not ready for a code review.</h2>
                                <p>You are ready. You will receive advice appropriate to you skill level and it will accelerate your learning. Just go for it.</p>

                                <h2>Speaking from experience</h2>
                                <p>If you are not convinced you need a code review or you are thinking it could be uncomfortable, here are a couple of my experiences that illustrate how important it is do get your code reviewed sooner rather than later.</p>
                                <h3>Don't let your first code review be like mine.</h3>
                                <p>I taught myself to code from books while in college. Along the way I wrote two programs that were in use by small business. However, I did this all on my own without the benefit of any collaboration. That may or may not seem strange but, it was the early nineties and most people didn't have a computer. I only had one friend who could write code. For my first interview I took one of these programs with me (on 3.5" floppy disk) to the interview as an example of my work. The users of the program loved it and I was very proud of it. The interviewer looked at my code and very nicely said, "Your work shows you understand how to use the language but you need to improve the structure of your code." No, I didn't get the job. I know now that 'improve the structure of your code' meant 'your code is immature and demonstrates your lack of experience'. In other words, the style, layout, organization and the way I wrote functions showed my inexperience.</p>
                                <h3>Interviewing Developers</h3>
                                <p>If you have read my profile or met me in person then you know that I started programming in the early 90s and spent about 20 years creating software for major corporations. Over that period I interviewed more than 50 developers. Most were experienced with good code quality. However, a few junior developers showed-up with poorly structured code and met the same fate as I did in my first interview. I gave them some friendly advice, wished them luck and moved on to the next candidate.</p>
