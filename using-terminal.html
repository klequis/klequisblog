  <p>I grew-up on Windows. My computing life started less than a year before Windows 3.0 and I did little more than use word processors such as WordStar and WordPerfect. The only command line commands I knew were for listing, moving, renaming and deleting files, and I did very little of that.</p>
  <p>Can you be a programmer and not know the command line? I nearly did. From Windows 3.0 to three years ago I developed Windows applications and I only rarely used the comand line. So yes, you can get by with very little command line savy.</p>
  <p>But that was then and I think it a bit unusual to not be good with a command line, especially in the Linux world. In fact, I'm not sure that it is possible to completely avoid the command line on Linux.</p>
  <p>Using the command line intimidates some people. However, it just takes some getting used to, and it will open-up some possibilities. If you are one of those intimitated by the command line just stick with it. Eventually it will become intuitive</p>
  <p>It will help to have a cheatsheet. This can be a text file or it can go into Evernote or OneNote. Keep it simple such as the table below.

    <h4>Permissions</h4>
    Although I would like to say that permissions are beyond the scope of this guide, they are present on every file listing and so hard to ignore. I will take a shallow dip into permissions and then list some good references for you at the bottom on the post.

  1. Open Terminal
  Super
  Type 'terminal'
  Press Enter

  2. Layout windows

  2.1 See what is in home directory
  $ ls
  $ ls -l (the -l option provides more information and a more readable layout)


  3. Create Sample Files
    $ cd ~/
    $ mkdir samplefiles
    $ cd samplefiles
    In Files, enter the samplefiles directory so you can see the files appear as we create them below.


  3.1 Clear - do it

    Method 1 - Using rediection
    $ > index.html
    Method 2 - using an editor
    $ gedit page1.html
    The file is not created until you save it in gEdit. Press Ctrl+s to save page1.html

    Check-out Terminal. You are not at the command prompt. When you exit gEdit you will be returned to the command prompt
    Ctrl+q (q for quit) to exit gEdit

    Method 3
    You can also create a file with some text.
    $ echo '&lt;h1&gt;Page 3&lt;/h1&gt;' > page2.html
    View file in Firefox
    $ firefox page2.html
    View file in gEdit
    $ gedit page2.html

    Let's create a location for our CSS files
    $ mkdir css
    $ cd css
    $ ls -l
    $ > styles.css
    $ > styles.mobile.css
    $ > styles.tablet.css

    Create JavaScript File
    $ cd ..
    $ > main.js
    We should have created that in a js directory so let's create the directory and move the file
    $ mkdir js
    $ mv main.js js


    -rw-rw-r-- 1 karl karl 0 May 28 08:50 test1.txt

    There are 10 parts to the output as shown below.

    It is confusing to have a user named 'karl' and a group named 'karl' in the example. I'll try to clear that up right after the next table. If after that it is causing confusion, leave a comment and I'll find a better approach.

  PERMISSIONS
  Understanding permissions is beyond the scop of this guide. However, you will need to view and change permissions at times so here is a quick introduction.
  $ cd ..
  $ >test1.txt
  $ ls -l test1.txt
    First a few definitions
    r
    w
    x
    -
    d

    -rw-rw-r-- 1 karl karl 0 May 28 08:50 test1.txt
    Now Let's take this apart
    - file
    **put each part in a table cell with a letter above it.

    "karl karl"
    The first 'karl' is the owner. I.e., the account I logged in with
    The second 'karl' is a group named 'karl'. That is confusing but I will clear it up some in a minute.

    -rw-rw-r--
    There are 10 characters in this string
    The first caracter will be "-" for a file and "d" for a directory
    "-" means it is a file, not a directory
    "d" means it is a file
    Then there are 3 groupings of 3 characters. The 3 characters in each group are r, w x (rwx) which mean
    "r" means read permission
    "w" means write permission
    "x" means execute permission
    "-" means the permission is not granted (does not have the permission)
    The first group of 3 is the owner's permissions
    The second group of 3 is the owning group's permissions
    The third group of 3 are the permissions for everyone else
    * They are always in the same order


Move / rename
Make directory
Delete file
Delete directory
Copy
List permissions with number
Change permission on files onlyList directory
Change permissions
Change owner (user)
Change owner (group)
