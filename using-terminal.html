  <p>I grew-up on Windows. My computing life started less than a year before Windows 3.0 and I did little more than use word processors such as WordStar and WordPerfect. The only command line commands I knew were for listing, moving, renaming and deleting files, and I did very little of that.</p>
  <p>Can you be a programmer and not know the command line? I nearly did. From Windows 3.0 to three years ago I developed Windows applications and I only rarely used the comand line. So yes, you can get by with very little command line savy, but perhaps not on Linux.</p>
  <p>But that was then and I think it a bit unusual to not be good with a command line, especially in the Linux world. In fact, I'm not sure that it is possible to completely avoid the command line on Linux.</p>
  <p>Using the command line intimidates some people. However, it just takes some getting used to, and it will open-up some possibilities. If you are one of those intimitated by the command line just stick with it. Eventually it will become intuitive</p>
  <p>I use Files (aka File Manager) for many tasks, especially moving/renaming files that I have permission to do so with. I use the command line when installing software requires it and when working with files that are owned by the system. So on a continium of always using command line to always using GUI tools, I'm somewhere in-between but close to the GUI end.

    <p>Whereever you see <code>$ </code> type into terminal the text that follows.</p>
    <p>For example, if you see <code>$ ls -la</code>, you type into terminal "ls -la" exactly as you see it with particular attention to capitalization and spaces.</p>

  <div class="ke-callout ke-callout-warning">

      <li>Everything you do in Terminal is case sensitive. If something doesn't work be sure to double check the case.</li>
      <li>You can open multiple tabs in terminal by pressing <kbd>Ctrl-t</kbd>.</li>
      <li>Spaces in file names require quotes. It is easiest to not put spaces in your file names.</li>
