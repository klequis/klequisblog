<p>This guide will show you how to isntall PHP. PHP is a server-side scripting language originally designed for web development but has been adapted to command line scripting and desktop (GUI) applications. We will only be installing the website server-side scripting capabilities.</p>
<p>PHP is a hugely popular. By one estimation it is used on over 80% of websites using server-side programming languages. Given the difficulty of data collection, this number may not be accurate, but even if it is off by 20%, it is clear that PHP is very popular.</p>

<h2>Install PHP</h2>
<p>Open Terminal and execute the below commands</p>
<pre>$ sudo apt-get install php libapache2-mod-php php-pear php-mysql</pre>

<p>Restart Apache so that the new modules will be loaded.</p>
<pre>$ sudo systemctl restart apache2</pre>
<p>Check out your version.</p>
<pre>$ php -v</pre> pic.001.php.version.png



<h2>Create a PHP-Info Site</h2>
<p>In a previous post we created a simple Hello World website using the command line. This time, just to provide a different experience, we will do it using a mix of command line and Files. I will provide the instructions for creating the virtual host in brief. If you get stuck, refer to the full post <a href="#">da da da</a>.</p>
<p>We need to take a quick diversion as newer versions of Files don't provide a way of creating a file from within Files. Follow the steps in <a href="#">this post</a> and then come back.</p>
<p>Open Files and navigate to Home > workspace</p>
<p>Create a directory named "phpinfopage".</p>pic.002.create.phpinfopage.dir.png
<p>Inside the directory phpinfopage, create a file named phpinfopage.php</p>
<p>Right-click phpinfopage.php and choose <btn>Open With gedit</btn>.</p>
<p>Enter the below text</p>
<pre>&lt;?php<br>phpinfo();<br>?&gt;</pre>   pic.003.phpinfopage.contents.png
<p>Save and close the file.</p>
<p>Previously we created the virtual host file from scratch. This time we will copy the existing file and modify it. See <a href="#">post</a> if you don't already have this file.</p>
<p>Execute these commands</p>
<pre>$ cd /etc/apache2/sites-available<br>$ sudo cp helloworld.conf phpinfopage.conf<br>$ sudo gedit phpinfopage.conf</pre>
<p>Edit the file to appear as the picture, replacing 'Karl' with your user name & 'helloworld' with 'phpinfopage'.</p>
<p>Save and close the file.</p>
<pre>$ sudo -i gedit /etc/hosts</pre>
<p>Add the below line.</p>
<pre>127.0.0.1       phpinfopage.localhost</pre>
<p>Close and save the file.</p> pic.004.hostfile.entry.png
<p>Enable the new site and restart Apache.</p>
<pre>sudo a2ensite phpinfopage.conf<br>sudo systemctl restart apache2</pre>
<p>Open a browser and enter this URL.</p>
<pre>http://phpinfopage.localhost</pre>
<p>The resulting page should like like the screenshot. There is a lot of information on this page. Take a look to see what is there.</p> pic.005.phpinfopage.png

<div class="ke-callout ke-callout-info">
  <p>Did you get the Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page or an error instead of the PHPInfo page? It is very likely you made a typo. Things like restarting you machine, using a different browser or clearing history/cookies should not be necessary but over the four years I have been doing this I frequently encounter problems and one of these things fixes it. In fact, I just had the situation where my PHPInfo page would not work in FireFox but did in Chromium. When I cleared history, etc. in FireFox it worked there as weel. So, the page is not loading, try the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Go through all of the steps again looking for a typo.</li>
    <li>If you didn't find a typo, try restarting you machine.</li>
    <li>If you are using FireFox try Chromium or the other way around.</li>
    <li>Clear all browsing history, cookies ..., everthing. Then try again.</li>
  </ul>
