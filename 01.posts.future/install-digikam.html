If you are using a distribution based on apt-get (Ubuntu, debian, ...), an easy way to install the dependencies is to use the commands:
sudo apt-get build-dep digikam
sudo apt-get build-dep kipi-plugins
Note that this method will provide the dependencies of the packaged version of Digikam, current svn version may contain more dependencies.
