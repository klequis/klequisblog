4. Enter you login password when prompted.
5. Wait for the installation to complete.
6. After a short while the dialog box shown will appear. It may open hidden by other windows. If you don't see it after a minute or so, look below other windows. This dialog is a bit confused since it is not clear if you should click StartDropbox or Next. I click Next
