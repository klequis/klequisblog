<h2>Who is the blog meant for?</h2>
<p>The target audience of this blog is people with basic to advance computer skills who want to learn to be software developers, or experienced developers  exploring new technologies.</p>

<h2>Who is Karl?</h2>
<p>I'm an aging software developer who doen't have to work 10+ hours a day anymore and so I have time to go back to were my career with software began - exploring technology that interests and facinates me.</p>

<p>I have played every major role in the software process from idea generation and requirements gathering to deployment. I have been an Excel guru, software developer, software develoment manager, project manager and product manager. While I have dabbled in many technologies, here are the ones I worked the most with in roughly chronical order:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Windows 3.0 - 8.1</li>
  <li>Excel, PowerPoint and Word automation using VBA</li>
  <li>Visual Basic 4 - 6</li>
  <li>Client / server developer</li>
  <li>Sybase</li>
  <li>SQL</li>
  <li>Documentum</li>
  <li>C#, WPF, Silverlight, ASP.NET</li>
  <li>Verity search engine</li>
  <li>SharePoint</li>
  <li>SQL Server</li>
  <li>Linux/Ubuntu</li>
  <li>Drupal</li>
  <li>MySQL</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>

<p>Applications I have build have been in the domains of user productivity, document authoring, document management, knowledge management, information overload, Investment Banking, market data and CRM.</p>

<p>My favorite part of the software development process is watching users make use of what I have been part of creating.</p>

<p>I am currently an organizer of a Bay Area Free Code Camp and a drone flyer.</p>

<h2>Why use Ubuntu?</h2>
<p>The short answer is that it is free, easy to install and easy get started with.</p>

<h2>Why use GNOME?</h2>
<p>Largely because the UI appeals to me more than the default Ubuntu Unity UI. I like the simplicity and the ability to customize it via shell extensions.</p>
