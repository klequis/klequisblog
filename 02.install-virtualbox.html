This guide will show you how to install VirtualBox 5.0 on Ubuntu.
<p class="ke-callout ke-callout-warning">This guide was written on Ubuntu GNOME 16.04 (64-bit) and I have only tested it on that version.</p>
VirtualBox is free software made by Oracle Corporation. A <b>virtual machine</b> is an 'emulation' of a particular computer system. There are different types of virtual machines. VirtualBox is a 'full virtualization VM' which is a complete operating system. As such, when you run a Ubuntu virtual machine on a Windows computer, you have the entire Ubuntu operating system running inside a window.

For in-depth information on virtual machines, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine">Wikipedia</a>.

 	<dt>Host</dt>
 	<dd>The 'host' is your computer. It is the operating system which boots when you turn on your computer. In this tutorial, the host computer is Windows 8.1.</dd>
 	<dt>Guest</dt>
 	<dd>The 'guest' is the computer you run inside of VirtualBox.</dd>
 	<dt>Virtual Machine (VM)</dt>
 	<dd>The guest is also called 'the virtual machine' and I will use these terms interchangeably.</dd>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>A computer running Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit.</li>
 	<li>At least 4GB of RAM</li>
 	<li>At least 20GB hard drive space.</li>
 	<li>VirtualBox itself does not use much disk space, but the virtual machine you will create does. The initial virtual machine will take-up about 8GB of hard disk space. However, it will grow as you install software and otherwise use it. 20 GB is plenty to get started but it is a conservative number.</li>
</ul>

<p class="ke-callout ke-callout-warning">Unless otherwise noted, all options/choices must be as show in the pictures.</p>
<p class="ke-callout ke-callout-warning">The Ubuntu Software Center has an install of VirtualBox. According to the reviews for that install, it is the 32-bit version. We will be using the 64-bit version by downloading it from virtualbox.org.</p>

<ol>
 	<li>Go to <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org">virtualbox.org</a> and download the installation for ubuntu 16.04 ("Xenial"). You will see two links labeled i386 (the 32-bit version) and AMD64 (the 64-bit version which we will be using).
<div class="ke-callout">You should go to the download page and make sure you have the most recent
download. However, the links as of today are:
<a href="http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.0.20/virtualbox-5.0_5.0.20-106931~Ubuntu~xenial_amd64.deb">VirtualBox for Ubuntu 16.04</a>
<a href="http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.0.20/VirtualBox-5.0.20-106931-Win.exe">Virtualbox for Windows</a></div></li>
 	<li>Using Files (i.e., the file manager) go to your Downloads directory.</li>
 	<li>Right-click the downloaded file (currently named virtualbox-5.0_5.0.20-106931-Ubuntu-xenial_amd64.deb) and choose Open With Software Install</li>
 	<li>Enter your password when prompted</li>
 	<li>Wait for the installation to complete before proceeding.</li>
 	<li>Use the below command to make sure you get updates
<pre><code>$ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian $(lsb_release -cs) contrib" &gt;&gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/virtualbox.list'</code></pre>
</li>
 	<li>Download the Oracle public key so that Software Install trusts the installation
<pre><code>$ wget -q https://www.virtualbox.org/download/oracle_vbox.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -</code></pre>
</li>
 	<li>Launch VirtualBox and check it out! You are ready to begin building your first Ubuntu virtual machine.&lt;/&gt;</li>
