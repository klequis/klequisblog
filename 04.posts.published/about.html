      <h2>About This Blog</h2>
      <p>This blog is inspired by my participation in <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com">Free Code Camp</a>. I began following the Free Code Camp online course several months ago and started <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Tri-Valley-East-Bay-Free-Code-Camp-Study-Group/">Tri-Valley / East Bay Free Code Camp Study Group</a> so I could have some company as I worked through the course. I have met many campers over the past several months and most of them have a common goal: They want to make their lives better and they are willing to put in the work to get there. I relate to that effort as 26 years ago I was a completely non-technical person in a non-technical career. Sure, I could program my VCR, but I had never pressed the on switch to a computer. I started coding as a hobby when a friend gave me an aging computer and through persistent effort and help from a couple of friends over the course of 3 years I launched a 20 year career making software.</p>
      <p>You can find our group on Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.sanramon/">Free Code Camp, San Ramon</a> and on Meetup <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Tri-Valley-East-Bay-Free-Code-Camp-Study-Group/">Tri-Valley / East Bay Free Code Camp Study Group</a>.</p>
      <p>The campers who come to <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Tri-Valley-East-Bay-Free-Code-Camp-Study-Group/">Tri-Valley / East Bay Free Code Camp Study Group</a> are smart and dedicated people striving to start a new career or to go to the next level in their current career. I hope this blog helps them on their journey.</p>

      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <p>The tutorials on this site are geared toward those learning to code. To effectively make use of the tutorials you only need basic computer skills such as using productivity tools (word processor or spreadsheet) and installing software. If you have these skills but do not know how to install and configure a code editor, database or web server, this blog is for you.</p>
      <p>The tutorials are very pictorial, which I hope is easier to follow than lots of words. Advanced users may find the tutorials overly simplistic but will still find them useful if they are trying something new such as switching from Windows or Mac to Linux.</p>
      <p>Although I am focused on Linux (for now), many of the skills taught are useful on other operating systems.</p>
      <p>It has been a very long time since I was a technical beginner. While I am striving to write tutorials that are easy for a novice developer to follow, I may no longer fully related to such a user. As such, comments on how to make the tutorials easier to follow are very welcome.</p>


      <h2>Who is Klequis?</h2>
      <p>As you will see in many of the screenshots, my name is Karl. I have been a software developer since the early 90s. and have played every major role in the software process from idea generation and requirements gathering to deployment. While working at large corporations I have been an Excel guru, software developer, software development manager, project manager and product manager. I have built applications in the domains of user productivity, document authoring, document management, knowledge management, information overload, Investment Banking, market data and CRM.</p>

      <p>My favorite part of the software development process is watching users make use of what I have been a part of creating.</p>

      <p>I am currently the leader of <a href="#">Free Code Camp, San Ramon</a>, organizer of <a href="#">Tri-Valley / East Bay Fee Code Camp Study Group</a> and a multirotor builder and flier.</p>

      <p>While I have dabbled in many technologies, here are the ones I worked with the most, in roughly chronological order:</p>
