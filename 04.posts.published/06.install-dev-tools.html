              FileZilla is an FTP application. As a web developer you will most often use it to move files between your local machine and your hosting account.

              Meld is a visual diff and merge tool targeted at developers. Meld helps you compare files, directories, and version controlled projects. It provides two and three-way comparison of both files and directories, and has support for many popular version control systems. Meld helps you review code changes and understand patches. It might even help you to figure out what is going on in that merge you keep avoiding.

        Is Chromium a developer tool? I would say 'yes'. If you are not familiar with Chromium's developer tools, install it, then go to a website using Chromium and press F12 to get a taste of what is there.

    <div class="panel-body">
      <p>Some of the applications listed above are best installed using Ubuntu's visual installation program 'Software'. The below shows how to use Software to install FileZilla. Repeat the process for Meld, GIMP, Shutter & Chromium.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
      <p>There is a version of Atom in Software but it is new, unrated and using a newly introduced installation technology. Therefore, I think it is best to install Atom from Atom's website.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to <a href="https://atom.io">atom.io</a>.</li>
        <li>Click on the orange "Download .deb" button and if prompted, click <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Save</button>.</li>
        <li>When the download is complete, go to your Downloads folder, right-click on 'atom-amd64.deb' and choose <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Open With Software Install</button>. This will launch the Software application.</li>
        <li>Click <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Install</button>.</li>

      <h2>Using Favorites</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
      <p>Ubuntu comes with a selection of applications pinned in Favorites. As a developer I don't use many of them, I use the developer applications we just installed, so I remove many of the default favorites and pin the ones I use most.</p>
      <p>I'll also add that I generally don't use favorites to launch applications because it is easier to press <kbd>Super</kbd> and type a few letters. I do use it as a status view of running applications. For example, press <kbd>Super</kbd>, type 'term' and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to launch Terminal.</p>
      <h3>Adding Applications to Favorites</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Press <kbd>Super</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Type 'Atom'.</li>
        <li>Right-click on the Atom icon and choose <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Add To Favorites</button>.</li>
        <li>Repeat this process for the other applications.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Cleaning-up Favorites</h3>
      <p>While we are here let's organize Favorites a little. For each application you will not be using frequently, right-click its icon and choose <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Remove from Favorites</button>.</p>
