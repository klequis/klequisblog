      <p>This post is an introduction to the next several tutorials in the series <a href=""></a> which will show you how to install the LAMP stack on a Ubuntu Linux machine.</p>
      <p>LAMP stands for <b>L</b>inux, <b>A</b>pache, <b>M</b>ySQL & <b>P</b>HP. It is a software stack comprised completely of free and open-source software. LAMP provides you with a web server to host your sites, a database to store your data and the PHP scripting language. It is an excellent environment for WordPress, Drupal and many other PHP based systems.</p>

      <h2>Update Installation Repositories</h2>
      <p>First run the below command to make sure you have the latest list of packages and dependencies.</p>
      <pre>$ sudo apt-get update</pre>
      <h2>Decide Your Passwords</h2>
      <p>You will need two passwords, one for Apache and another for MySQL. Both of these will be for what is called the root user (aka SuperUser). Apache and MySQL each have their own separate root user with their own password (as Ubuntu has its own as well). These are very powerful accounts that if not used carefully can do damage to your Apache or MySQL installation. If you were building a machine that was accessible from the public internet it would be important to have very strong passwords for root. However, the development machine you are building will run inside of VirtualBox and unless you specifically configure VirtualBox to do otherwise, the machine will not be accessible to the public internet, your LAN (e.g., home/work network) nor even the machine it is hosted on. Therefore, it is safe to have a simple and short password. 4 characters will do, and simple to type because you will do so often.</p>
      <p>You may be tempted to have no password at all but this will change how some things are done and may cost you some rework when you try to deploy to production.</p>
      <p>So decide your passwords now and write them down somewhere safe. While they can be changed if you loose them, it will use time that could be spent more productively.</p>
      <p>You will need two passwords. It is OK for reasons explained above if they are the same:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>MySQL password</li>
        <li>phpMyAdmin password</li>
      </ol>
      <p>With that out of the way, we are ready to install LAMP on our Virtual Machine.</p>
