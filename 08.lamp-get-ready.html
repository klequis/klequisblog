      <h2>Update Installation Repositories</h2>
      <p>First run the below command to make sure you have the latest list of packages and dependencies.</p>
      <pre>$ sudo apt-get update</pre>
      <h2>Decide Your Passwords</h2>
      <p>You will need two passwords, one for Apache and another for MySQL. Both of these will be for what is called the root user (aka SuperUser). These are very powerful accounts that if not used carefully can do damage to your Apache or MySQL installation. If you were building a machine that was accessible from the public internet it would be important to have very strong passwords. However, the development machine you are building will run inside of VirtualBox and unless you specifically configure VirtualBox to do otherwise, the machine will not be accessible to the public internet, your LAN (e.g., home/work network) nor even the machine it is hosted on. Therefore, it is save to have a simple and short password. 4 letters will do.</p>
      <p>You may be tempted to have no password at all but this will change how things are configured. If you do it this way you may find when deployed, your site/applications doesn't work now that it is running where a password is required. Use a password and get used to it.</p>
      <p>So decide you passwords now and write them down somewhere safe. While they can be changed if you loose them, it will use time that could be spent more productively.</p>
