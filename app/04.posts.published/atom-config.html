        <p>A little over a year ago I got back into development and wanted a free editor. I tried Sublime, Brackets and Atom. Brackets wouldn't install on my Linux machine and although there is likely a way to get it working I felt an editor that needed
          research to install was a bad bet. I very much liked Sublime but didn't want to deal with the nagging to pay for it. It is well worth paying for but I wasn't up to it at that time. As a result I switched to Atom and found it easy to configure
          compared to Sublime and so I have stuck with it since.</p>
        <p>Out of the box Atom is a very simple editor. However, there are, at this moment, 6,023 packages available to customize atom in terms of functionality and appearance. To find the packages you want you can <a href="https://atom.io/packages">search the atom repository</a>          by the type of functionality you are looking for and/or Goggle for Atom packages of interest.</p>
        <p>Atom is often criticized for being slow and unable to open very large files. Neither of these present a problem for me. Atom does take some number of seconds to launch. However, I don't open and close it much during the day so it isn't a problem
          for me. Atom has crashed when I was opening a very large file, say bootstrap.css, but I rarely do that and have other editors on hand for when I do such as gEdit and Sublime.</p>
        <p>Below we will install Atom, install packages and then change a few settings in the editor. The setup is based on how I have Atom setup. My focus is the JavaScript, HTML, CSS &amp; React. If you are working with these technologies my setup will be a good starting point for you.</p>
        <p class="ke-callout ke-callout-info">Are you a new programmer that hasn't settled on an editor yet? <i>Choose one of the most popular ones and stick with it.</i> Knowing your editor well, particularly the keyboard shortcuts, configuration and addons, will improve you productivity.</p>

        <h2>Installing Atom</h2>
        <p>If you do not have Atom installed go to <a href="https://atom.io">atom.io</a> and download the install for your system. The installation instructions can be found in the <a href="http://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/">Atom Flight Manual</a>.</p>

        <h2>Installing Packages</h2>
        <p>You can install packages using the Atom UI but the fastest way is to use the <code>$ apm</code> command from the command line. The format is</p>
        <pre>$ apm install <i>package1</i> <i>package2</i> <i>packageN</i></pre>
        <p>Here is the command to install all the packages listed above</p>
        <pre>apm install highlight-selected seti-ui pigments atom-beautify auto-detect-indentation rest-client git-plus merge-conflicts autocomplete-modules custom-title expose todo-show git-time-machine goto-definition atom-ternjs autocomplete-paths docblockr glowing-cursor markdown-preview-plus linter linter-csslint linter-eslint linter-htmlhint open-in-browser browser-plus language-babel</pre>

        <h2>Here are the editor settings I prefer</h2>
        <p>In Atom choose Edit&gt;Preferences and then the Editor tab on the left.</p>
        <p>Change settings to match the below.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Scroll Past End = checked</li>
          <li>Show Indent Guide = checked</li>
          <li>Show Invisibles = checked</li>
          <li>Soft Tabs = checked</li>
          <li>Soft Wrap = checked</li>
          <li>Tab Length = 2</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>A nice theme with icons which show file type</h2>
        <p>The Seti theme was installed when we use the 'apm' command above. It needs to be activated.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>In the settings page, choose 'Themes' on the left</li>
          <li>Set UI Theme = Seti</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I set the syntax theme to Base16 Tomorrow Dark</p>
