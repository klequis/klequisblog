    So you want to be a software developer. Maybe you have never coded, maybe you have started learning or perhaps you are at the beginning of your career as a software developer. Whatever state of becoming you are in, here is some stuff on what being a software developer is all about.

  <p><i>The views expressed below are my opinion and are not stated as fact, final, nor true for all people all the time. They are based on my 20+ years of making software wherein I worked with many software developers, most very talented and a few not so much. I have hired quite a few developers and fired a couple as well.</i></p>
  <p>
    You want to become a software developer and you have a few questions such as 'how to get started?', 'how long will it take?' and maybe even 'can I really do it?'. These are all great questions for which there are different answers for different people and there are always exceptions to almost everything.
  </p>

  <h2>Persistence</h2>
  <p>
    Persistence is the defining quality of success in all persuits so I'll speak to it first. Software development is hard! While you are learning, and for the entirety of you career, you will experience short-term fustration and failure. This is the very nature of making software. It is complex, there is a lot to learn, much more than the syntax of your choosen language, there is always something new to learn, and things often don't work as advertised.
  </p>
  <p>
    So if it is so hard and fustrating why bother? Why not try something easier? I can think of several reasons but I'm sure there are more: 1) it pays well, 2) getting things to work is reawarding and 3) you get to make something, in this case software.

  <h2>It takes a long time (bootcamps, online courses and promises)</h2>
  <p>
    Some people will go to a bootcamp and when done they will get a job. Others will not get the job. I know little about bootcamps except that I have met 2 people who got the job and 1 person who ended-up with debt and no job. If you are starting from scratch you will still be a beginner in 3 to 6 months.

    OK, I hear a challenge to that last statement. There are people who claim to have done it and I'm not going to second guess them. I have just never had the opportunity to get to know one in a way that I could tell you how they did it. Personally, I don't think it is possible but maybe there are people who can due to talent or intelligence.
  </p>
  <p>So how long does it take? Here is how it worked out for me. I started coding while in college for a business degree. I did it as much as I could given my class and work schedule. I'm trying to guess how much time I actually got to code but it was a long time ago and I'm not a great believer in the accuracy of memory. So I'm going to throw out 10 hours a week. I did this for 2 years and managed to create 2 useful small programs that worked well but as I was to find out later, were of poor quality and architecture. After college it took me 5 months to find work and during this time I spent 2 to 5 hours per day learning to code. When I got hired it was because I was was good with spreadsheets, not because I was a good coder. I'll also speculate that it was the early ninties and the demand for programmers was skyrocketing.</p>
  <p>Here is my opinion: If you have 4 to 5 hours to learn per day you will be able to create simple programs in 6 months. After a year you will be getting comfortable with things and after 2 years you may be good enough that I might hire you (if I were still hiring people) providing you can demonstrate your skills by showing me what you have built and talking about it and answering questions in a way that shows you understand what you did.</p>
