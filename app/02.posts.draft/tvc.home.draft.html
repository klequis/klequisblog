  <p>The Tri-Valley Coders is just getting started but the group is well established and has great momentum (or: has been around for over a year). We are 180 members strong and have had over 75 in-person meetings in our first year. </p>
  <p>Tri-Valley Coders is a comfortable non-competitive place to learn about making software, both in person and online, for beginners and vetrans alike. Our members span the gammute in terms of age and experience, but they all have one thing in common, they are learning something new and looking to take the next step in their lives.</p>
  <p>The groups works with the latest technolgoies including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, Redux, Express and MongoDB.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML5</li>
    <li>CSS3</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>React</li>
    <li>Redux</li>
    <li>Express</li>
    <li>MongoDB</li>
  </ul>

  <p>At Tri-Valley Coders we are not just focused on writing code, we are making software and call ourselves 'software developers' because, while writing code is fun, we all want to make an app or service and deploy it to users.</p>

  <p>Tri-Valle Coders is not 180 members strong. In the past 12 months we have had more than 75 in-person meetings. The normal meeting size is 5 to 10 people (which isn't a lot but then try to get individual attention in a group of 50).</p>

  <p>You can come to one our in-person sessions for any of the following reasons</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Get help with a secific problem</li>
    <li>Get advice on what to learn, how to approach learning, best learning resources and even a bit of career advice.</li>
    <li>Make connections</li>
    <li>Or just be in the company of others with a common interest</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Tri-Valley Coders</h1>
  <h2>Intro</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>at tvc we are not focused on learning to code, we make software.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What is your goal?</h2>
  <h2>Don't code - make software</h2>

  <h2>Leverage the group</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>motivation</li>
    <li>help understading things</li>
    <li>direction - get on course, stay on course</li>
    <li>help with a specific problem</li>
    <li>tech stack: react, webpack, node/express, javascript, html, css</li>
    <li>a place for beginners to get started</li>
    <li>working with the latest technologies</li>
    <li>a comfortable place for beginners and a challenging place for the experienced/changer.</li>
    <li>Reading code: Learning to read code is hard. Even if you know the syntax, finding missing braces, scanning 10s of lines of code with understanding, sifting through error messages is a skill unto itself. It is as if you went to an alternate universe where almost everything, every detail looked different than the universe you came. You don't know what many of the things you see are and even with some you recognize, there are differences you eye/mind is not yet trained to see. This is how it goes. Live in your new universie for enough time and you will begin to distinguish.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How To Learn</h2>
  <p>After a year of exploring and watching people learn we use a variety of tools to help people learn how to code/make software. There is no one resource that will do it all for you.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You Don't Know Java Script</li>
  </ul>
