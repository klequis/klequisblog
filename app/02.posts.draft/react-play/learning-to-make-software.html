<p>I'm tempted to call this post 'Learing to Code', but is that what you really want to do? Writing code is fun for some of us, including me, but for most people it needs to have a larger goal and I can't think of any other reason to write code then to create software. Wow, that is obvious and I would have not said it if the pharse 'learn to code' were not so common. I think it should be replaced with 'learn to make software'. So, with that out of the way, how do you learn to make software.</p>
<p>Coding is a big part of making software and there are many types of code. There is what most people mean, the language, such as C, JavaScript, Phthon ... the list is long. But there is also HTML, CSS and things such as templating languages. These are all forms of coding. But there are many other large categories that fit under 'making software' such as graphic design, business analysis and project management, to name a few. And let's not forget teamwork which I'll get to in a little bit.</p>
<h2>The Myth of the Full-Stack Developer</h2>
<p>The term full-stack means developers who are comfortable working with both back-end and front-end technologies. To be more specific, it means that the developer can work with databases, PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and everything in between, also, venturing as far as converting Photoshop designs to front-end code.</p>
<p>'Full-stack developer' is not completely a myth. It depends on what you are building and what technologies you are using.</p>
